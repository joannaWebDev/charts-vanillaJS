      <p><strong>Methodology</strong>: 182 fintechs reported subscription revenue as their primary source of revenue and
        it was common among firms
        offering accounting & budgeting, digital banking and account/API aggregation services. Fintechs have their
        traditional revenue models through commissions, transactions, affiliation and interest when they are offering
        financial services like payment, digital banking or lending services, however a large number of fintechs (268)
        have ‘Unknown’ as their revenue model which reflects the value created through collaborations.
        Since the openbanking standards enable the fintechs to collaborate with banks as well as build products using
        bank
        APIs, the revenue generated is shared among the fintechs and the banks. This could be a combination of different
        revenue streams depending on the service which could range from commission-based, freemium and data-analytic
        sales.</p>
